        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a quick and easy way to make something delicious. Whether you are working
            frequently and don't have the time or you just detest cooking, this dish has you covered.
            It is based off a traditional Moroccan cuisine whereby succulent pieces of meat and steamed vegetables are added
            to the couscous followed by an almost soup-like broth.  
        </p>
        <p>We have decided to focus on making the couscous portion of the dish. This means that you can 
            add to and flavour the dish however you like! For instance, you could add meat, chicken
            and whatever vegetables you desire to enhance the flavour.
